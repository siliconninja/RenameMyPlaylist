To install dependencies (required libraries) for the Rename My Playlist app,
go to your root/backend project directory (cd) and type the following in a terminal or command prompt:

npm install cookie-parser
npm install express
npm install querystring
npm install request
npm install util

(^^ You only need to install the util package if you plan on debugging the application ^^)
